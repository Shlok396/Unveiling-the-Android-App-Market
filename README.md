THE OUTCOME IN BRIEF
The analysis revealed that the Google Play Store is dominated by free applications, with categories such as Family and Game having the highest number of apps. Most applications have ratings above 4.0, indicating positive user feedback. Higher-rated apps generally attract more installs, while app size has minimal impact on ratings. Overall, the project provided valuable insights into app market trends and strengthened practical data analytics and visualization skills.
